# [Team enolp musk@SMM4H’22 : Leveraging Pre-trained Language Models for Stance And Premise Classification]()
This repository contains our approaches on the Shared Task "Classification of Stance & Premise in tweets about health mandates related to COVID-19 (in English)" at the [7th Social Media Mining for Health Applications (#SMM4H) workshop](https://healthlanguageprocessing.org/smm4h-2022/) at COLING 2022

Users are actively sharing their views on various issues on social networks. Nowadays, these issues are often related to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, users express their attitude towards a quarantine and wearing masks in public places. Some statements are reasoned by arguments, other statements are just emotional claims. Automated approaches for detecting people's stances towards health orders related to COVID-19, using Twitter posts, can help to estimate the level of cooperation with the mandates. In this task we focus on argument mining (or argumentation mining) for extracting arguments from COVID-related tweets. According to argumentation theory, an argument must include a claim containing a stance towards some topic or object, and at least one premise/argument (“favor” or “against”) of this stance.
